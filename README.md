# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

Can a computer understand a number written by hand? ✍️  
This project answers that question by building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to recognize handwritten digits using the **MNIST Dataset**, along with an interactive GUI that provides real-time predictions with confidence scores.

---

## Project Overview
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits (0–9) using a CNN model built with **TensorFlow & Keras**.  
An interactive **Gradio GUI** allows users to upload digit images and get **real-time predictions with confidence scores**.
